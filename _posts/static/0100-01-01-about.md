**TermMed IT** is a Buenos Aires-based company involved in the development and implementation of software solutions and services applied to the maintenance and implementation of [SNOMED CT](http://www.ihtsdo.org/snomed-ct/) and related terminology resources and extensions.

Our focus is the development of software supporting collaborative processes that contribute to improve the quality of SNOMED CT and its regional adoption, in the belief that better clinical information systems will result in better healthcare.

We have developed open-source software components for the IHTSDO Workbench and continue to support and extend them. Our lines of work include terminology rule-based QA, editing workflows and release processes.
